# Data Structures and Algorithms Used

## Data Structures

- Arrays
- Maps
- Objects
- Queue/Priority Queue

## Algorithms

- Breadth-first Search
- Dijkstra's
- A\*

The goal is to implement and compare various pathfinder algorithms. The pathfinders operate on a graph of interconnected nodes. The graph in this project is represented by a 2D array.

As for the traversal of nodes and figuring out the shortest path, implementations of a queue and priority queue are used since these are more performant in comparison to using a regular array.

JavaScript maps and arrays will be used throughout the program to hold variables and mappings. Built in array methods may eventually be replaced by home-made ones if necessary.

The algorithms were chosen due to their prevalence and my personal familiarity with them.

## Program Input

The program input will consist of options selected on the user interface. All of the pathfinders work on the same grid based on the start and end nodes selected and other options that the UI provides.

The user also selects the algorithm they wish to see perform.

### Expected Time Complexities
