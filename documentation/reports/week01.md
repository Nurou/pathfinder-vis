# What I did this week

I had chosen the idea and has started thinking about concrete implementations before this week, and I carried on with that.

# Progress

I had managed to get a crude version working on a separate test project, and will be porting the functionality over and refining it.

# What I learned?

I refreshed my knowledge of pathfinder algorithms and the differences between them, including their time complexities.

# Problems/Issues

The UI implementation of the graph and the pathfinders. I did not want to spend time learning data visualisation libraries/frameworks, and doing the project with DOM manipulation is not optimal.

# What next?

I will continue adding functionality - testing + writing the algorithms and UI components.
