# What I did this week

- Worked on replacing ready-provided methods with custom ones, inc. push and pop functions for the priority queue, and looking into how to replace Map data structures used throughout
- Polished the UI and fixed bugs on it
- Worked on adding option to control speed of animation
- Started looking into different heuristic functions

# What I learned?

- How to implement array methods by extending arrays in JavaScript
- More about how Maps work internally
- Typescript quirks

# Problems/Issues

I'm unsure as to the best way to replace Map data structures used in the algorithms.

# What next?

I will carry on with trying to replace data structures provided by JavaScript with custom ones.
