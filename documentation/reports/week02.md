# What I did this week

Carried on working on both the UI and algorithmic logic. I began testing and added a priority queue data structure. Looked further at the theory and possible implementations.

# Progress

The project is progressing well. I experience some hurdles with TypeScript, but nothing major.

# What I learned?

Mainly TypeScript and React specific things, including how to optimise rendering a large number of divs on the browser.

# Problems/Issues

Nothing too significant.

# What next?

I hope to add the rest of the algorithms in the coming weeks and add functionality to the UI, including animations for the pathfinders. Also, some I probably have to replace some of the implementations provided by JavaScript out of the box.
