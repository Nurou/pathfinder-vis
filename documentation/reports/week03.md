# What I did this week

I added Dijkstra's uniform-cost search algorithm to the project, along with added features to the UI that allow comparisons between the different algorithms to be shows. More specifically, the comparison of total number of nodes traversed and total movement cost.

I also added a random maze generator.

# Problems/Issues

The biggest challenge was dealing with the case in which there was no shortest path due to walls blocking the route.
