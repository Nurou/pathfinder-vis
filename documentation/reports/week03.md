# What I did this week

I added Dijkstra's uniform-cost search algorithm to the project, along with added features to the UI that allow comparisons between the different algorithms to be shows. More specifically, the comparison of total number of nodes traversed and total movement cost.

I also added a random maze generator, and improved overall code readability and structure.

In addition, tests were added for the following data structures:

- PriorityQueue
- Node

# What I learned?

I mainly learned about heuristic search as it applies to pathfinders.

# Problems/Issues

There was a bug in the pathfinder where an infinite loop was run when no path was available. That was fixed.

# What next?

Add A\* algorithm, along with its test and start working on custom implementations of any ready-made data structures used.
