# What has been tested and how

The project will contain unit tests. The test framework used will be Jest (TODO: _add link_)

To be tested:

- pathfinder algorithms
- any custom data structure implementations
- UI components (if there's time)

# What types of input were used (especially important for comparative analysis)

TODO

# How can the tests be repeated

The tests can be run following the instructions on the README page (TODO: link)

# Results of empirical testing presented in graphical form

TODO
